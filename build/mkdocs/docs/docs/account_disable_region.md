### Description

### Usage

### Arguments

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 35%" />
<col style="width: 65%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code id="account_disable_region_:_AccountId">AccountId</code></td>
<td><p>Specifies the 12-digit account ID number of the Amazon Web
Services account that you want to access or modify with this operation.
If you don't specify this parameter, it defaults to the Amazon Web
Services account of the identity used to call the operation. To use this
parameter, the caller must be an identity in the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_getting-started_concepts.html#account">organization's
management account</a> or a delegated administrator account. The
specified account ID must also be a member account in the same
organization. The organization must have <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html">all
features enabled</a>, and the organization must have <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/">trusted
access</a> enabled for the Account Management service, and optionally a
<a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/">delegated
admin</a> account assigned.</p>
<p>The management account can't specify its own <code>AccountId</code>.
It must call the operation in standalone context by not including the
<code>AccountId</code> parameter.</p>
<p>To call this operation on an account that is not a member of an
organization, don't specify this parameter. Instead, call the operation
using an identity belonging to the account whose contacts you wish to
retrieve or modify.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code
id="account_disable_region_:_RegionName">RegionName</code></td>
<td><p>[required] Specifies the Region-code for a given Region name (for
example, <code>af-south-1</code>). When you disable a Region, Amazon Web
Services performs actions to deactivate that Region in your account,
such as destroying IAM resources in the Region. This process takes a few
minutes for most accounts, but this can take several hours. You cannot
enable the Region until the disabling process is fully
completed.</p></td>
