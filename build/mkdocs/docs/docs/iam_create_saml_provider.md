## Creates an IAM resource that describes an identity provider (IdP) that supports SAML 2

### Description

Creates an IAM resource that describes an identity provider (IdP) that
supports SAML 2.0.

The SAML provider resource that you create with this operation can be
used as a principal in an IAM role's trust policy. Such a policy can
enable federated users who sign in using the SAML IdP to assume the
role. You can create an IAM role that supports Web-based single sign-on
(SSO) to the Amazon Web Services Management Console or one that supports
API access to Amazon Web Services.

When you create the SAML provider resource, you upload a SAML metadata
document that you get from your IdP. That document includes the issuer's
name, expiration information, and keys that can be used to validate the
SAML authentication response (assertions) that the IdP sends. You must
generate the metadata document using the identity management software
that is used as your organization's IdP.

This operation requires [Signature Version
4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-signing.html).

For more information, see [Enabling SAML 2.0 federated users to access
the Amazon Web Services Management
Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-saml.html)
and [About SAML 2.0-based
federation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_saml.html)
in the *IAM User Guide*.
