## Generates a set of credentials consisting of a user name and password that can be used to access the service specified in the request

### Description

Generates a set of credentials consisting of a user name and password
that can be used to access the service specified in the request. These
credentials are generated by IAM, and can be used only for the specified
service.

You can have a maximum of two sets of service-specific credentials for
each supported service per user.

You can create service-specific credentials for CodeCommit and Amazon
Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra).

You can reset the password to a new service-generated value by calling
`reset_service_specific_credential`.

For more information about service-specific credentials, see [Using IAM
with CodeCommit: Git credentials, SSH keys, and Amazon Web Services
access
keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_ssh-keys.html)
in the *IAM User Guide*.
