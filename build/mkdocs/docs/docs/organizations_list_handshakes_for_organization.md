## Lists the handshakes that are associated with the organization that the requesting user is part of

### Description

Lists the handshakes that are associated with the organization that the
requesting user is part of. The `list_handshakes_for_organization`
operation returns a list of handshake structures. Each structure
contains details and status about a handshake.

Handshakes that are `ACCEPTED`, `DECLINED`, `CANCELED`, or `EXPIRED`
appear in the results of this API for only 30 days after changing to
that state. After that, they're deleted and no longer accessible.

Always check the `NextToken` response parameter for a `null` value when
calling a `⁠List*⁠` operation. These operations can occasionally return an
empty set of results even when there are more results available. The
`NextToken` response parameter value is `null` *only* when there are no
more results to display.

This operation can be called only from the organization's management
account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an
Amazon Web Services service.

### Usage

    organizations_list_handshakes_for_organization(Filter, NextToken,
      MaxResults)

### Arguments

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 35%" />
<col style="width: 65%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code
id="organizations_list_handshakes_for_organization_:_Filter">Filter</code></td>
<td><p>A filter of the handshakes that you want included in the
response. The default is all types. Use the <code>ActionType</code>
element to limit the output to only a specified type, such as
<code>INVITE</code>, <code>ENABLE-ALL-FEATURES</code>, or
<code>APPROVE-ALL-FEATURES</code>. Alternatively, for the
<code>ENABLE-ALL-FEATURES</code> handshake that generates a separate
child handshake for each member account, you can specify the
<code>ParentHandshakeId</code> to see only the handshakes that were
generated by that parent request.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code
id="organizations_list_handshakes_for_organization_:_NextToken">NextToken</code></td>
<td><p>The parameter for receiving additional results if you receive a
<code>NextToken</code> response in a previous request. A
<code>NextToken</code> response indicates that more output is available.
Set this parameter to the value of the previous call's
<code>NextToken</code> response to indicate where the output should
continue from.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code
id="organizations_list_handshakes_for_organization_:_MaxResults">MaxResults</code></td>
<td><p>The total number of results that you want included on each page
of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a
value that is specific to the operation. If additional items exist
beyond the maximum you specify, the <code>NextToken</code> response
element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as
the <code>NextToken</code> request parameter in the next call to the
operation to get the next part of the results. Note that Organizations
might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more
results available. You should check <code>NextToken</code> after every
operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.</p></td>
