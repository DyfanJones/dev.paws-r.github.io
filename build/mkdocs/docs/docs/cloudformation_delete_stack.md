## Deletes a specified stack

### Description

Deletes a specified stack. Once the call completes successfully, stack
deletion starts. Deleted stacks don't show up in the `describe_stacks`
operation if the deletion has been completed successfully.

### Usage

    cloudformation_delete_stack(StackName, RetainResources, RoleARN,
      ClientRequestToken)

### Arguments

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 35%" />
<col style="width: 65%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code
id="cloudformation_delete_stack_:_StackName">StackName</code></td>
<td><p>[required] The name or the unique stack ID that's associated with
the stack.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code
id="cloudformation_delete_stack_:_RetainResources">RetainResources</code></td>
<td><p>For stacks in the <code>DELETE_FAILED</code> state, a list of
resource logical IDs that are associated with the resources you want to
retain. During deletion, CloudFormation deletes the stack but doesn't
delete the retained resources.</p>
<p>Retaining resources is useful when you can't delete a resource, such
as a non-empty S3 bucket, but you want to delete the stack.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code id="cloudformation_delete_stack_:_RoleARN">RoleARN</code></td>
<td><p>The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access
Management (IAM) role that CloudFormation assumes to delete the stack.
CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your
behalf.</p>
<p>If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was
previously associated with the stack. If no role is available,
CloudFormation uses a temporary session that's generated from your user
credentials.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code
id="cloudformation_delete_stack_:_ClientRequestToken">ClientRequestToken</code></td>
<td><p>A unique identifier for this <code>delete_stack</code> request.
Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation
knows that you're not attempting to delete a stack with the same name.
You might retry <code>delete_stack</code> requests to ensure that
CloudFormation successfully received them.</p>
<p>All events initiated by a given stack operation are assigned the same
client request token, which you can use to track operations. For
example, if you execute a <code>create_stack</code> operation with the
token <code>token1</code>, then all the <code>StackEvents</code>
generated by that operation will have <code>ClientRequestToken</code>
set as <code>token1</code>.</p>
<p>In the console, stack operations display the client request token on
the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use
the token format <em>Console-StackOperation-ID</em>, which helps you
easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack
using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in
the following format: <code
style="white-space: pre;">⁠Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002⁠</code>.</p></td>
