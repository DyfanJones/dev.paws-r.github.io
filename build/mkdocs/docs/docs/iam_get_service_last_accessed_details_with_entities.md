## After you generate a group or policy report using the GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails operation, you can use the JobId parameter in GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities

### Description

After you generate a group or policy report using the
`generate_service_last_accessed_details` operation, you can use the
`JobId` parameter in `get_service_last_accessed_details_with_entities`.
This operation retrieves the status of your report job and a list of
entities that could have used group or policy permissions to access the
specified service.

-   **Group** – For a group report, this operation returns a list of
    users in the group that could have used the group’s policies in an
    attempt to access the service.

-   **Policy** – For a policy report, this operation returns a list of
    entities (users or roles) that could have used the policy in an
    attempt to access the service.

You can also use this operation for user or role reports to retrieve
details about those entities.

If the operation fails, the
`get_service_last_accessed_details_with_entities` operation returns the
reason that it failed.

By default, the list of associated entities is sorted by date, with the
most recent access listed first.

### Usage

    iam_get_service_last_accessed_details_with_entities(JobId,
      ServiceNamespace, MaxItems, Marker)

<tr class="even">
<td><code
id="iam_get_service_last_accessed_details_with_entities_:_ServiceNamespace">ServiceNamespace</code></td>
<td><p>[required] The service namespace for an Amazon Web Services
service. Provide the service namespace to learn when the IAM entity last

<p>To learn the service namespace for a service, see <a

resources, and condition keys for Amazon Web Services services</a> in
the <em>IAM User Guide</em>. Choose the name of the service to view
details for that service. In the first paragraph, find the service
prefix. For example, <code
style="white-space: pre;">⁠(service prefix: a4b)⁠</code>. For more
information about service namespaces, see <a

<td><p>Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum

beyond the maximum you specify, the <code>IsTruncated</code> response

<p>If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to
100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more
results available. In that case, the <code>IsTruncated</code> response
element returns <code>true</code>, and <code>Marker</code> contains a
value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to
continue from.</p></td>

id="iam_get_service_last_accessed_details_with_entities_:_Marker">Marker</code></td>
<td><p>Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after
you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it
to the value of the <code>Marker</code> element in the response that you
received to indicate where the next call should start.</p></td>
