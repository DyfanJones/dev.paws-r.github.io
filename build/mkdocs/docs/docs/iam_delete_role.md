## Deletes the specified role

### Description

Deletes the specified role. Unlike the Amazon Web Services Management
Console, when you delete a role programmatically, you must delete the
items attached to the role manually, or the deletion fails. For more
information, see [Deleting an IAM
role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_manage_delete.html#roles-managingrole-deleting-cli).
Before attempting to delete a role, remove the following attached items:

-   Inline policies (`delete_role_policy`)

-   Attached managed policies (`detach_role_policy`)

-   Instance profile (`remove_role_from_instance_profile`)

-   Optional â€“ Delete instance profile after detaching from role for
    resource clean up (`delete_instance_profile`)

Make sure that you do not have any Amazon EC2 instances running with the
role you are about to delete. Deleting a role or instance profile that
is associated with a running instance will break any applications
running on the instance.
