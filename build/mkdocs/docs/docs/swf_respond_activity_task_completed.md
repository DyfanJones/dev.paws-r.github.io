## Used by workers to tell the service that the ActivityTask identified by the taskToken completed successfully with a result (if provided)

### Description

Used by workers to tell the service that the ActivityTask identified by
the `taskToken` completed successfully with a `result` (if provided).
The `result` appears in the `ActivityTaskCompleted` event in the
workflow history.

If the requested task doesn't complete successfully, use
`respond_activity_task_failed` instead. If the worker finds that the
task is canceled through the `canceled` flag returned by
`record_activity_task_heartbeat`, it should cancel the task, clean up
and then call `respond_activity_task_canceled`.

A task is considered open from the time that it is scheduled until it is
closed. Therefore a task is reported as open while a worker is
processing it. A task is closed after it has been specified in a call to
RespondActivityTaskCompleted, `respond_activity_task_canceled`,
`respond_activity_task_failed`, or the task has [timed
out](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dg-basic.html#swf-dev-timeout-types).

**Access Control**

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
resources as follows:

-   Use a `Resource` element with the domain name to limit the action to
    only specified domains.

-   Use an `Action` element to allow or deny permission to call this
    action.

-   You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the
action fails. The associated event attribute's `cause` parameter is set
to `OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`. For details and example IAM policies, see
[Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF
Workflows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html)
in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide*.

### Usage

    swf_respond_activity_task_completed(taskToken, result)

### Arguments

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 35%" />
<col style="width: 65%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code
id="swf_respond_activity_task_completed_:_taskToken">taskToken</code></td>
<td><p>[required] The <code>taskToken</code> of the ActivityTask.</p>
<p><code>taskToken</code> is generated by the service and should be
treated as an opaque value. If the task is passed to another process,
its <code>taskToken</code> must also be passed. This enables it to
provide its progress and respond with results.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code
id="swf_respond_activity_task_completed_:_result">result</code></td>
<td><p>The result of the activity task. It is a free form string that is
implementation specific.</p></td>

### Value

An empty list.

### Request syntax

    svc$respond_activity_task_completed(
      taskToken = "string",
      result = "string"
