## Used by activity workers to report to the service that the ActivityTask represented by the specified taskToken is still making progress

### Description

Used by activity workers to report to the service that the ActivityTask
represented by the specified `taskToken` is still making progress. The
worker can also specify details of the progress, for example percent
complete, using the `details` parameter. This action can also be used by
the worker as a mechanism to check if cancellation is being requested
for the activity task. If a cancellation is being attempted for the
specified task, then the boolean `cancelRequested` flag returned by the
service is set to `true`.

This action resets the `taskHeartbeatTimeout` clock. The
`taskHeartbeatTimeout` is specified in `register_activity_type`.

This action doesn't in itself create an event in the workflow execution
history. However, if the task times out, the workflow execution history
contains a `ActivityTaskTimedOut` event that contains the information
from the last heartbeat generated by the activity worker.

The `taskStartToCloseTimeout` of an activity type is the maximum
duration of an activity task, regardless of the number of
`record_activity_task_heartbeat` requests received. The
`taskStartToCloseTimeout` is also specified in `register_activity_type`.

This operation is only useful for long-lived activities to report
liveliness of the task and to determine if a cancellation is being
attempted.

If the `cancelRequested` flag returns `true`, a cancellation is being
attempted. If the worker can cancel the activity, it should respond with
`respond_activity_task_canceled`. Otherwise, it should ignore the
cancellation request.

**Access Control**

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
resources as follows:

-   Use a `Resource` element with the domain name to limit the action to
    only specified domains.

-   Use an `Action` element to allow or deny permission to call this
    action.

-   You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the
action fails. The associated event attribute's `cause` parameter is set
to `OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`. For details and example IAM policies, see
[Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF
Workflows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html)
in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide*.

### Usage

    swf_record_activity_task_heartbeat(taskToken, details)

### Arguments

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 35%" />
<col style="width: 65%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code
id="swf_record_activity_task_heartbeat_:_taskToken">taskToken</code></td>
<td><p>[required] The <code>taskToken</code> of the ActivityTask.</p>
<p><code>taskToken</code> is generated by the service and should be
treated as an opaque value. If the task is passed to another process,
its <code>taskToken</code> must also be passed. This enables it to
provide its progress and respond with results.</p></td>

id="swf_record_activity_task_heartbeat_:_details">details</code></td>
<td><p>If specified, contains details about the progress of the
task.</p></td>

A list with the following syntax:

    list(
      cancelRequested = TRUE|FALSE
    )

### Request syntax

    svc$record_activity_task_heartbeat(
