## Creates a forecast for each item in the TARGET\_TIME\_SERIES dataset that was used to train the predictor

### Description

Creates a forecast for each item in the `TARGET_TIME_SERIES` dataset
that was used to train the predictor. This is known as inference. To
retrieve the forecast for a single item at low latency, use the
operation. To export the complete forecast into your Amazon Simple
Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, use the `create_forecast_export_job`
operation.

The range of the forecast is determined by the `ForecastHorizon` value,
which you specify in the `create_predictor` request. When you query a
forecast, you can request a specific date range within the forecast.

To get a list of all your forecasts, use the `list_forecasts` operation.

The forecasts generated by Amazon Forecast are in the same time zone as
the dataset that was used to create the predictor.

For more information, see howitworks-forecast.

The `Status` of the forecast must be `ACTIVE` before you can query or
export the forecast. Use the `describe_forecast` operation to get the
status.

By default, a forecast includes predictions for every item (`item_id`)
in the dataset group that was used to train the predictor. However, you
can use the `TimeSeriesSelector` object to generate a forecast on a
subset of time series. Forecast creation is skipped for any time series
that you specify that are not in the input dataset. The forecast export
file will not contain these time series or their forecasted values.

### Usage

    forecastservice_create_forecast(ForecastName, PredictorArn,
      ForecastTypes, Tags, TimeSeriesSelector)

<td><p>[required] A name for the forecast.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code
id="forecastservice_create_forecast_:_PredictorArn">PredictorArn</code></td>
<td><p>[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the predictor to use
to generate the forecast.</p></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td><code
id="forecastservice_create_forecast_:_ForecastTypes">ForecastTypes</code></td>
<td><p>The quantiles at which probabilistic forecasts are generated.
<strong>You can currently specify up to 5 quantiles per
forecast</strong>. Accepted values include <code
style="white-space: pre;">⁠0.01 to 0.99⁠</code> (increments of .01 only)
and <code>mean</code>. The mean forecast is different from the median
(0.50) when the distribution is not symmetric (for example, Beta and
Negative Binomial).</p>
<p>The default quantiles are the quantiles you specified during
predictor creation. If you didn't specify quantiles, the default values
are <code
style="white-space: pre;">⁠["0.1", "0.5", "0.9"]⁠</code>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code id="forecastservice_create_forecast_:_Tags">Tags</code></td>
<td><p>The optional metadata that you apply to the forecast to help you
categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional
value, both of which you define.</p>
<p>The following basic restrictions apply to tags:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.</p></li>
<li><p>For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key
can have only one value.</p></li>
<li><p>Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.</p></li>
<li><p>Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.</p></li>
<li><p>If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed
characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and
spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ :
/ @.</p></li>
<li><p>Tag keys and values are case sensitive.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not use <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠aws:⁠</code>, <code
style="white-space: pre;">⁠AWS:⁠</code>, or any upper or lowercase
combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for Amazon
Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix.
Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has <code>aws</code> as its
prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag
and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key
prefix of <code>aws</code> do not count against your tags per resource
limit.</p></li>
