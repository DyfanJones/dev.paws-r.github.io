### Description

Represents the success of a job as returned to the pipeline by a job
worker. Used for custom actions only.

### Usage

    codepipeline_put_job_success_result(jobId, currentRevision,
      continuationToken, executionDetails, outputVariables)

### Arguments

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 35%" />
<col style="width: 65%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code
id="codepipeline_put_job_success_result_:_jobId">jobId</code></td>
<td><p>[required] The unique system-generated ID of the job that
succeeded. This is the same ID returned from
<code>poll_for_jobs</code>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code
id="codepipeline_put_job_success_result_:_currentRevision">currentRevision</code></td>
<td><p>The ID of the current revision of the artifact successfully
worked on by the job.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code
id="codepipeline_put_job_success_result_:_continuationToken">continuationToken</code></td>
<td><p>A token generated by a job worker, such as a CodeDeploy
deployment ID, that a successful job provides to identify a custom
action in progress. Future jobs use this token to identify the running
instance of the action. It can be reused to return more information
about the progress of the custom action. When the action is complete, no
continuation token should be supplied.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code
id="codepipeline_put_job_success_result_:_executionDetails">executionDetails</code></td>
<td><p>The execution details of the successful job, such as the actions
taken by the job worker.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code
id="codepipeline_put_job_success_result_:_outputVariables">outputVariables</code></td>
<td><p>Key-value pairs produced as output by a job worker that can be
made available to a downstream action configuration.
<code>outputVariables</code> can be included only when there is no
continuation token on the request.</p></td>
