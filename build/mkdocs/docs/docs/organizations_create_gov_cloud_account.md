## This action is available if all of the following are true:

### Description

This action is available if all of the following are true:

-   You're authorized to create accounts in the Amazon Web Services
    GovCloud (US) Region. For more information on the Amazon Web
    Services GovCloud (US) Region, see the [*Amazon Web Services
    GovCloud User
    Guide*.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/welcome.html)

-   You already have an account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US)
    Region that is paired with a management account of an organization
    in the commercial Region.

-   You call this action from the management account of your
    organization in the commercial Region.

-   You have the `organizations:CreateGovCloudAccount` permission.

Organizations automatically creates the required service-linked role
named `AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations`. For more information, see
[Organizations and Service-Linked
Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html#orgs_integrate_services-using_slrs)
in the *Organizations User Guide.*

Amazon Web Services automatically enables CloudTrail for Amazon Web
Services GovCloud (US) accounts, but you should also do the following:

-   Verify that CloudTrail is enabled to store logs.

-   Create an Amazon S3 bucket for CloudTrail log storage.

    For more information, see [Verifying CloudTrail Is
    Enabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/verifying-cloudtrail.html)
    in the *Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide*.

If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the
`organizations:TagResource` permission. The tags are attached to the
commercial account associated with the GovCloud account, rather than the
GovCloud account itself. To add tags to the GovCloud account, call the
`tag_resource` operation in the GovCloud Region after the new GovCloud
account exists.

You call this action from the management account of your organization in
the commercial Region to create a standalone Amazon Web Services account
in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region. After the account is
created, the management account of an organization in the Amazon Web
Services GovCloud (US) Region can invite it to that organization. For
more information on inviting standalone accounts in the Amazon Web
Services GovCloud (US) to join an organization, see
[Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-organizations.html)
in the *Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide.*

Calling `create_gov_cloud_account` is an asynchronous request that
Amazon Web Services performs in the background. Because
`create_gov_cloud_account` operates asynchronously, it can return a
successful completion message even though account initialization might
still be in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you
can successfully access the account. To check the status of the request,
do one of the following:

-   Use the `OperationId` response element from this operation to
    provide as a parameter to the `describe_create_account_status`
    operation.

-   Check the CloudTrail log for the `CreateAccountResult` event. For
    information on using CloudTrail with Organizations, see [Monitoring
    the Activity in Your
    Organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/)
    in the *Organizations User Guide.*

When you call the `create_gov_cloud_account` action, you create two
accounts: a standalone account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US)
Region and an associated account in the commercial Region for billing
and support purposes. The account in the commercial Region is
automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the
request. Both accounts are associated with the same email address.

A role is created in the new account in the commercial Region that
allows the management account in the organization in the commercial
Region to assume it. An Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account is
then created and associated with the commercial account that you just
created. A role is also created in the new Amazon Web Services GovCloud
(US) account that can be assumed by the Amazon Web Services GovCloud
(US) account that is associated with the management account of the
commercial organization. For more information and to view a diagram that
explains how account access works, see
[Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-organizations.html)
in the *Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide.*

For more information about creating accounts, see [Creating an Amazon
Web Services account in Your
Organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html)
in the *Organizations User Guide.*

-   When you create an account in an organization using the
    Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information
    required for the account to operate as a standalone account is *not*
    automatically collected. This includes a payment method and signing
    the end user license agreement (EULA). If you must remove an account
    from your organization later, you can do so only after you provide
    the missing information. Follow the steps at [To leave an
    organization as a member
    account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#leave-without-all-info)
    in the *Organizations User Guide.*

-   If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your
    account limits for the organization, contact Amazon Web Services
    Support.

-   If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed
    because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and
    then try again. If the error persists, contact Amazon Web Services
    Support.

-   Using `create_gov_cloud_account` to create multiple temporary
    accounts isn't recommended. You can only close an account from the
    Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management console, and you
    must be signed in as the root user. For information on the
    requirements and process for closing an account, see [Closing an
    Amazon Web Services
    account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_close.html)
    in the *Organizations User Guide*.

When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose
whether to create the account with the **IAM User and Role Access to
Billing Information** switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and
roles that have appropriate permissions can view billing information for
the account. If you disable it, only the account root user can access
billing information. For information about how to disable this switch
for an account, see [Granting Access to Your Billing Information and
Tools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/control-access-billing.html).

the role, as permitted by the management account administrator. The role
has administrator permissions in the new member account.</p>

GovCloud account exists.</p>
<p>For each tag in the list, you must specify both a tag key and a
