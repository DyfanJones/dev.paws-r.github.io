## Returns the attachment that has the specified ID

### Description

Returns the attachment that has the specified ID. Attachments can
include screenshots, error logs, or other files that describe your
issue. Attachment IDs are generated by the case management system when
you add an attachment to a case or case communication. Attachment IDs
are returned in the AttachmentDetails objects that are returned by the
`describe_communications` operation.

-   You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support
    plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

-   If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account that
    doesn't have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support
    plan, the `SubscriptionRequiredException` error message appears. For
    information about changing your support plan, see [Amazon Web
    Services Support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/).
