## Retrieves the service last accessed data report for Organizations that was previously generated using the GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport operation

### Description

Retrieves the service last accessed data report for Organizations that
was previously generated using the
`generate_organizations_access_report` operation. This operation
retrieves the status of your report job and the report contents.

Depending on the parameters that you passed when you generated the
report, the data returned could include different information. For
details, see `generate_organizations_access_report`.

To call this operation, you must be signed in to the management account
in your organization. SCPs must be enabled for your organization root.
You must have permissions to perform this operation. For more
information, see [Refining permissions using service last accessed
data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html)
in the *IAM User Guide*.

For each service that principals in an account (root user, IAM users, or
IAM roles) could access using SCPs, the operation returns details about
the most recent access attempt. If there was no attempt, the service is
listed without details about the most recent attempt to access the
service. If the operation fails, it returns the reason that it failed.

By default, the list is sorted by service namespace.

### Usage

    iam_get_organizations_access_report(JobId, MaxItems, Marker, SortKey)

### Arguments

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 35%" />
<col style="width: 65%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code
id="iam_get_organizations_access_report_:_JobId">JobId</code></td>
<td><p>[required] The identifier of the request generated by the
<code>generate_organizations_access_report</code> operation.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code
id="iam_get_organizations_access_report_:_MaxItems">MaxItems</code></td>
<td><p>Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum
number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist
beyond the maximum you specify, the <code>IsTruncated</code> response
element is <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to
100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more
results available. In that case, the <code>IsTruncated</code> response
element returns <code>true</code>, and <code>Marker</code> contains a
value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to
continue from.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code
id="iam_get_organizations_access_report_:_Marker">Marker</code></td>
<td><p>Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after
you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it
to the value of the <code>Marker</code> element in the response that you
received to indicate where the next call should start.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code
id="iam_get_organizations_access_report_:_SortKey">SortKey</code></td>
<td><p>The key that is used to sort the results. If you choose the
namespace key, the results are returned in alphabetical order. If you
choose the time key, the results are sorted numerically by the date and
time.</p></td>
</tr>
