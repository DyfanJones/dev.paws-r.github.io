## Used by activity workers and task states using the callback pattern to report to Step Functions that the task represented by the specified taskToken is still making progress

### Description

Used by activity workers and task states using the
[callback](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-to-resource.html#connect-wait-token)
pattern to report to Step Functions that the task represented by the
specified `taskToken` is still making progress. This action resets the
`Heartbeat` clock. The `Heartbeat` threshold is specified in the state
machine's Amazon States Language definition (`HeartbeatSeconds`). This
action does not in itself create an event in the execution history.
However, if the task times out, the execution history contains an
`ActivityTimedOut` entry for activities, or a `TaskTimedOut` entry for
for tasks using the [job
run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-to-resource.html#connect-sync)
or
[callback](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-to-resource.html#connect-wait-token)
pattern.

The `Timeout` of a task, defined in the state machine's Amazon States
Language definition, is its maximum allowed duration, regardless of the
number of `send_task_heartbeat` requests received. Use
`HeartbeatSeconds` to configure the timeout interval for heartbeats.

### Usage

    sfn_send_task_heartbeat(taskToken)

### Arguments

<colgroup>
<col style="width: 35%" />
<col style="width: 65%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code id="sfn_send_task_heartbeat_:_taskToken">taskToken</code></td>
<td><p>[required] The token that represents this task. Task tokens are
generated by Step Functions when tasks are assigned to a worker, or in
the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/input-output-contextobject.html">context
object</a> when a workflow enters a task state. See
GetActivityTaskOutput$taskToken.</p></td>

### Value

An empty list.

### Request syntax

    svc$send_task_heartbeat(
      taskToken = "string"
    )
