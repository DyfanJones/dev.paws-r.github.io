## Used by workers to tell the service that the ActivityTask identified by the taskToken was successfully canceled

### Description

Used by workers to tell the service that the ActivityTask identified by
the `taskToken` was successfully canceled. Additional `details` can be
provided using the `details` argument.

These `details` (if provided) appear in the `ActivityTaskCanceled` event
added to the workflow history.

Only use this operation if the `canceled` flag of a
`record_activity_task_heartbeat` request returns `true` and if the
activity can be safely undone or abandoned.

A task is considered open from the time that it is scheduled until it is
closed. Therefore a task is reported as open while a worker is
processing it. A task is closed after it has been specified in a call to
`respond_activity_task_completed`, RespondActivityTaskCanceled,
`respond_activity_task_failed`, or the task has [timed
out](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dg-basic.html#swf-dev-timeout-types).

**Access Control**

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
resources as follows:

-   Use a `Resource` element with the domain name to limit the action to
    only specified domains.

-   Use an `Action` element to allow or deny permission to call this
    action.

-   You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the
action fails. The associated event attribute's `cause` parameter is set
to `OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`. For details and example IAM policies, see
[Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF
Workflows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html)
in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide*.
