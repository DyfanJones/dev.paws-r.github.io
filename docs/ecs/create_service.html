<meta property="og:title" content="Runs and maintains a desired number of tasks from a specified task
definition — ecs_create_service" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Runs and maintains a desired number of tasks from a specified task
definition. If the number of tasks running in a service drops below the
desiredCount, Amazon ECS runs another copy of the task in the
specified cluster. To update an existing service, see the UpdateService
action.
In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service,
you can optionally run your service behind one or more load balancers.
The load balancers distribute traffic across the tasks that are
associated with the service. For more information, see Service Load Balancing
in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered
healthy if they're in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that do
use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING
state and the container instance that they're hosted on is reported as
healthy by the load balancer.
There are two service scheduler strategies available:
REPLICA - The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the
desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service
scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task
placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement
decisions. For more information, see Service Scheduler Concepts
in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
DAEMON - The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task
on each active container instance that meets all of the task
placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service
scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running
tasks and will stop tasks that do not meet the placement
constraints. When using this strategy, you don't need to specify a
desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service
Auto Scaling policies. For more information, see Service Scheduler Concepts
in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.


You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service.
The deployment is triggered by changing properties, such as the task
definition or the desired count of a service, with an UpdateService
operation. The default value for a replica service for
minimumHealthyPercent is 100%. The default value for a daemon service
for minimumHealthyPercent is 0%.
If a service is using the ECS deployment controller, the minimum
healthy percent represents a lower limit on the number of tasks in a
service that must remain in the RUNNING state during a deployment, as
a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded up to the nearest
integer), and while any container instances are in the DRAINING state
if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter
enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For
example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a
minimum healthy percent of 50%, the scheduler might stop two existing
tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. Tasks
for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if
they're in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that do use a load
balancer are considered healthy if they're in the RUNNING state and
they're reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for
minimum healthy percent is 100%.
If a service is using the ECS deployment controller, the maximum
percent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of tasks in
a service that are allowed in the RUNNING or PENDING state during a
deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded down
to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the
DRAINING state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch
type. This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size.
For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a
maximum percent value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks
before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster
resources required to do this are available). The default value for
maximum percent is 200%.
If a service is using either the CODE_DEPLOY or EXTERNAL deployment
controller types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the minimum
healthy percent and maximum percent values are used only to define
the lower and upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that
remain in the RUNNING state while the container instances are in the
DRAINING state. If the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch
type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values aren't
used, although they're currently visible when describing your service.
When creating a service that uses the EXTERNAL deployment controller,
you can specify only parameters that aren't controlled at the task set
level. The only required parameter is the service name. You control your
services using the CreateTaskSet operation. For more information, see
Amazon ECS Deployment Types
in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task
placement in your cluster using the following logic:
Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can
support your service's task definition (for example, they have the
required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).
By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across
Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a
different placement strategy) with the placementStrategy
parameter):
Sort the valid container instances, giving priority to instances
that have the fewest number of running tasks for this service in
their respective Availability Zone. For example, if zone A has
one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid
container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal
for placement.
Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an
optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps),
favoring container instances with the fewest number of running
tasks for this service.

latest <code>ACTIVE</code> revision is used.</p>
<p>A task definition must be specified if the service is using either the
<code>ECS</code> or <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> deployment controllers.</p></td>

    <tr>
      <th>loadBalancers</th>
      <td><p>A load balancer object representing the load balancers to use with your
service. For more information, see <a href='https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html'>Service Load Balancing</a>
in the <em>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</em>.</p>
<p>If the service is using the rolling update (<code>ECS</code>) deployment controller
and using either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer,
you must specify one or more target group ARNs to attach to the service.
The service-linked role is required for services that make use of
multiple target groups. For more information, see <a href='https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html'>Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon ECS</a>
in the <em>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</em>.</p>
<p>If the service is using the <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> deployment controller, the
service is required to use either an Application Load Balancer or
Network Load Balancer. When creating an AWS CodeDeploy deployment group,
you specify two target groups (referred to as a <code>targetGroupPair</code>).
During a deployment, AWS CodeDeploy determines which task set in your
service has the status <code>PRIMARY</code> and associates one target group with
it, and then associates the other target group with the replacement task
set. The load balancer can also have up to two listeners: a required
listener for production traffic and an optional listener that allows you
perform validation tests with Lambda functions before routing production
traffic to it.</p>
<p>After you create a service using the <code>ECS</code> deployment controller, the
load balancer name or target group ARN, container name, and container
port specified in the service definition are immutable. If you are using
the <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> deployment controller, these values can be changed
when updating the service.</p>
<p>For Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, this object
must contain the load balancer target group ARN, the container name (as
it appears in a container definition), and the container port to access
from the load balancer. The load balancer name parameter must be
omitted. When a task from this service is placed on a container
instance, the container instance and port combination is registered as a
target in the target group specified here.</p>
<p>For Classic Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer
name, the container name (as it appears in a container definition), and
the container port to access from the load balancer. The target group
ARN parameter must be omitted. When a task from this service is placed
on a container instance, the container instance is registered with the
load balancer specified here.</p>
<p>Services with tasks that use the <code>awsvpc</code> network mode (for example,
those with the Fargate launch type) only support Application Load
Balancers and Network Load Balancers. Classic Load Balancers are not
supported. Also, when you create any target groups for these services,
you must choose <code>ip</code> as the target type, not <code>instance</code>, because tasks
that use the <code>awsvpc</code> network mode are associated with an elastic
network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance.</p></td>

<p>A capacity provider strategy consists of one or more capacity providers

provider must be associated with the cluster to be used in a capacity
provider strategy. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API is used to
associate a capacity provider with a cluster. Only capacity providers
with an <code>ACTIVE</code> or <code>UPDATING</code> status can be used.</p>
<p>If a <code>capacityProviderStrategy</code> is specified, the <code>launchType</code> parameter

<p>If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the
capacity provider must already be created. New capacity providers can be
created with the CreateCapacityProvider API operation.</p>
<p>To use a AWS Fargate capacity provider, specify either the <code>FARGATE</code> or
<code>FARGATE_SPOT</code> capacity providers. The AWS Fargate capacity providers
are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a

<p>If your account has already created the Amazon ECS service-linked role,
that role is used by default for your service unless you specify a role

own elastic network interface, and it is not supported for other network

      <th>healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds</th>
      <td><p>The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler
should ignore unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health checks
after a task has first started. This is only used when your service is
configured to use a load balancer. If your service has a load balancer
defined and you don't specify a health check grace period value, the
default value of <code>0</code> is used.</p>
<p>If your service's tasks take a while to start and respond to Elastic
Load Balancing health checks, you can specify a health check grace
period of up to 2,147,483,647 seconds. During that time, the Amazon ECS
service scheduler ignores health check status. This grace period can
prevent the service scheduler from marking tasks as unhealthy and
stopping them before they have time to come up.</p></td>

      <th>schedulingStrategy</th>
      <td><p>The scheduling strategy to use for the service. For more information,
see
<a href='https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html'>Services</a>.</p>
<p>There are two service scheduler strategies available:</p><ul>
<li><p><code>REPLICA</code>-The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the
desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service
scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task
placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement
decisions. This scheduler strategy is required if the service is
using the <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> or <code>EXTERNAL</code> deployment controller types.</p></li>
<li><p><code>DAEMON</code>-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on
each active container instance that meets all of the task placement
constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler
also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and
will stop tasks that do not meet the placement constraints. When
you're using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired
number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto
Scaling policies.</p>
<p>Tasks using the Fargate launch type or the <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> or
<code>EXTERNAL</code> deployment controller types don't support the <code>DAEMON</code>
scheduling strategy.</p></li>

      <th>tags</th>
      <td><p>The metadata that you apply to the service to help you categorize and
organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of
which you define. When a service is deleted, the tags are deleted as
well.</p>
<p>The following basic restrictions apply to tags:</p><ul>
<li><p>Maximum number of tags per resource - 50</p></li>
<li><p>For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can
have only one value.</p></li>
<li><p>Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8</p></li>
<li><p>Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8</p></li>
<li><p>If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on
allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters,
numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following
characters: + - = . \_ : / @.</p></li>
<li><p>Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not use <code>aws:</code>, <code>AWS:</code>, or any upper or lowercase combination of
such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for AWS
use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix.
Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource
limit.</p></li>
