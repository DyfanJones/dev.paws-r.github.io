<meta property="og:title" content="AWS Global Accelerator — globalaccelerator" />
<meta property="og:description" content="This is the AWS Global Accelerator API Reference. This guide is for
developers who need detailed information about AWS Global Accelerator
API actions, data types, and errors. For more information about Global
Accelerator features, see the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide.
AWS Global Accelerator is a service in which you create accelerators to
improve availability and performance of your applications for local and
global users.
You must specify the US West (Oregon) Region to create or update
accelerators.
By default, Global Accelerator provides you with static IP addresses
that you associate with your accelerator. (Instead of using the IP
addresses that Global Accelerator provides, you can configure these
entry points to be IPv4 addresses from your own IP address ranges that
you bring to Global Accelerator.) The static IP addresses are anycast
from the AWS edge network and distribute incoming application traffic
across multiple endpoint resources in multiple AWS Regions, which
increases the availability of your applications. Endpoints can be
Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, EC2 instances, or
Elastic IP addresses that are located in one AWS Region or multiple
Regions.
Global Accelerator uses the AWS global network to route traffic to the
optimal regional endpoint based on health, client location, and policies
that you configure. The service reacts instantly to changes in health or
configuration to ensure that internet traffic from clients is directed
to only healthy endpoints.
Global Accelerator includes components that work together to help you
improve performance and availability for your applications:Static IP address


By default, AWS Global Accelerator provides you with a set of static IP
addresses that are anycast from the AWS edge network and serve as the
single fixed entry points for your clients. Or you can configure these
entry points to be IPv4 addresses from your own IP address ranges that
you bring to Global Accelerator (BYOIP). For more information, see
Bring Your Own IP Addresses (BYOIP)
in the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide. If you already have
load balancers, EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses set up for your
applications, you can easily add those to Global Accelerator to allow
the resources to be accessed by the static IP addresses.
The static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long
as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer
accepts or routes traffic. However, when you delete an accelerator,
you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no
longer route traffic by using them. You can use IAM policies with Global
Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an
accelerator. For more information, see Authentication and Access Control
in the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide.

Accelerator


An accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global
network to improve availability and performance for your internet
applications that have a global audience. Each accelerator includes one
or more listeners.

DNS name


Global Accelerator assigns each accelerator a default Domain Name System
(DNS) name, similar to a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com,
that points to your Global Accelerator static IP addresses. Depending on
the use case, you can use your accelerator\'s static IP addresses or DNS
name to route traffic to your accelerator, or set up DNS records to
route traffic using your own custom domain name.

Network zone


A network zone services the static IP addresses for your accelerator
from a unique IP subnet. Similar to an AWS Availability Zone, a network
zone is an isolated unit with its own set of physical infrastructure.
When you configure an accelerator, by default, Global Accelerator
allocates two IPv4 addresses for it. If one IP address from a network
zone becomes unavailable due to IP address blocking by certain client
networks, or network disruptions, then client applications can retry on
the healthy static IP address from the other isolated network zone.

Listener


A listener processes inbound connections from clients to Global
Accelerator, based on the protocol and port that you configure. Each
listener has one or more endpoint groups associated with it, and traffic
is forwarded to endpoints in one of the groups. You associate endpoint
groups with listeners by specifying the Regions that you want to
distribute traffic to. Traffic is distributed to optimal endpoints
within the endpoint groups associated with a listener.

Endpoint group


Each endpoint group is associated with a specific AWS Region. Endpoint
groups include one or more endpoints in the Region. You can increase or
reduce the percentage of traffic that would be otherwise directed to an
endpoint group by adjusting a setting called a traffic dial. The
traffic dial lets you easily do performance testing or blue/green
deployment testing for new releases across different AWS Regions, for
example.

Endpoint


An endpoint is a Network Load Balancer, Application Load Balancer, EC2
instance, or Elastic IP address. Traffic is routed to endpoints based on
several factors, including the geo-proximity to the user, the health of
the endpoint, and the configuration options that you choose, such as
endpoint weights. For each endpoint, you can configure weights, which
are numbers that you can use to specify the proportion of traffic to
route to each one. This can be useful, for example, to do performance
testing within a Region.
