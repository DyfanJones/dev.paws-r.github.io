<meta property="og:title" content="AWS Organizations — organizations" />

<meta property="og:description" content="AWS Organizations API Reference
AWS Organizations is a web service that enables you to consolidate your
multiple AWS accounts into an organization and centrally manage your
accounts and their resources.
This guide provides descriptions of the Organizations API. For more
information about using this service, see the AWS Organizations User Guide.
API Version
This version of the Organizations API Reference documents the
Organizations API version 2016-11-28.
As an alternative to using the API directly, you can use one of the AWS
SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming
languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, and more). The
SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS
Organizations. For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically
signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically.
For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and
install them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services.
We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to
Organizations. However, you also can use the Organizations Query API to
make direct calls to the Organizations web service. To learn more about
the Organizations Query API, see Making Query Requests
in the AWS Organizations User Guide. Organizations supports GET and
POST requests for all actions. That is, the API does not require you to
use GET for some actions and POST for others. However, GET requests are
subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for operations that
require larger sizes, use a POST request.
Signing Requests
When you send HTTP requests to AWS, you must sign the requests so that
AWS can identify who sent them. You sign requests with your AWS access
key, which consists of an access key ID and a secret access key. We
strongly recommend that you do not create an access key for your root
account. Anyone who has the access key for your root account has
unrestricted access to all the resources in your account. Instead,
create an access key for an IAM user account that has administrative
privileges. As another option, use AWS Security Token Service to
generate temporary security credentials, and use those credentials to
sign requests.
To sign requests, we recommend that you use Signature Version 4.
If you have an existing application that uses Signature Version 2, you
do not have to update it to use Signature Version 4. However, some
operations now require Signature Version 4. The documentation for
operations that require version 4 indicate this requirement.
When you use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or one of the AWS
SDKs to make requests to AWS, these tools automatically sign the
requests for you with the access key that you specify when you configure
the tools.
In this release, each organization can have only one root. In a future
release, a single organization will support multiple roots.
Support and Feedback for AWS Organizations
We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to
feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com or post your feedback and
questions in the AWS Organizations support forum. For more
information about the AWS support forums, see Forums Help.
Endpoint to Call When Using the CLI or the AWS API
For the current release of Organizations, you must specify the
us-east-1 region for all AWS API and CLI calls. You can do this in the
CLI by using these parameters and commands:
Use the following parameter with each command to specify both the
endpoint and its region:
--endpoint-url https://organizations.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Use the default endpoint, but configure your default region with
this command:
aws configure set default.region us-east-1
Use the following parameter with each command to specify the
endpoint:
--region us-east-1
" />

<meta property="og:description" content="For the various SDKs used to call the APIs, see the documentation for
the SDK of interest to learn how to direct the requests to a specific
endpoint. For more information, see Regions and Endpoints
in the AWS General Reference.
How examples are presented
The JSON returned by the AWS Organizations service as response to your
requests is returned as a single long string without line breaks or
formatting whitespace. Both line breaks and whitespace are included in
the examples in this guide to improve readability. When example input
parameters also would result in long strings that would extend beyond
the screen, we insert line breaks to enhance readability. You should
always submit the input as a single JSON text string.
Recording API Requests
AWS Organizations supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that records AWS
API calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3
bucket. By using information collected by AWS CloudTrail, you can
determine which requests were successfully made to Organizations, who
made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about AWS
Organizations and its support for AWS CloudTrail, see Logging AWS Organizations Events with AWS CloudTrail
in the AWS Organizations User Guide. To learn more about CloudTrail,
including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide." />
