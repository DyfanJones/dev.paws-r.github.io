<meta property="og:title" content="Retrieves an MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) URL for
the stream — kinesisvideoarchivedmedia_get_dash_streaming_session_url" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Retrieves an MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) URL for
the stream. You can then open the URL in a media player to view the
stream contents.
Both the StreamName and the StreamARN parameters are optional, but
you must specify either the StreamName or the StreamARN when
invoking this API operation.
An Amazon Kinesis video stream has the following requirements for
providing data through MPEG-DASH:
The media must contain h.264 or h.265 encoded video and, optionally,
AAC or G.711 encoded audio. Specifically, the codec ID of track 1
should be V_MPEG/ISO/AVC (for h.264) or V\_MPEGH/ISO/HEVC (for
H.265). Optionally, the codec ID of track 2 should be A_AAC (for
AAC) or A\_MS/ACM (for G.711).
Data retention must be greater than 0.
The video track of each fragment must contain codec private data in
the Advanced Video Coding (AVC) for H.264 format and HEVC for H.265
format. For more information, see MPEG-4 specification ISO/IEC 14496-15. For information
about adapting stream data to a given format, see NAL Adaptation Flags.
The audio track (if present) of each fragment must contain codec
private data in the AAC format (AAC specification ISO/IEC 13818-7) or the MS Wave format.


The following procedure shows how to use MPEG-DASH with Kinesis Video
Streams:
Get an endpoint using
GetDataEndpoint,
specifying GET_DASH_STREAMING_SESSION_URL for the APIName
parameter.
Retrieve the MPEG-DASH URL using GetDASHStreamingSessionURL.
Kinesis Video Streams creates an MPEG-DASH streaming session to be
used for accessing content in a stream using the MPEG-DASH protocol.
GetDASHStreamingSessionURL returns an authenticated URL (that
includes an encrypted session token) for the session's MPEG-DASH
manifest (the root resource needed for streaming with MPEG-DASH).
Don't share or store this token where an unauthorized entity could
access it. The token provides access to the content of the stream.
Safeguard the token with the same measures that you would use with
your AWS credentials.
The media that is made available through the manifest consists only
of the requested stream, time range, and format. No other media data
(such as frames outside the requested window or alternate bitrates)
is made available.
Provide the URL (containing the encrypted session token) for the
MPEG-DASH manifest to a media player that supports the MPEG-DASH
protocol. Kinesis Video Streams makes the initialization fragment
and media fragments available through the manifest URL. The
initialization fragment contains the codec private data for the
stream, and other data needed to set up the video or audio decoder
and renderer. The media fragments contain encoded video frames or
encoded audio samples.
The media player receives the authenticated URL and requests stream
metadata and media data normally. When the media player requests
data, it calls the following actions:
GetDASHManifest: Retrieves an MPEG DASH manifest, which
contains the metadata for the media that you want to playback.
GetMP4InitFragment: Retrieves the MP4 initialization
fragment. The media player typically loads the initialization
fragment before loading any media fragments. This fragment
contains the &quot;fytp&quot; and &quot;moov&quot; MP4 atoms, and the child
atoms that are needed to initialize the media player decoder.
The initialization fragment does not correspond to a fragment in
a Kinesis video stream. It contains only the codec private data
for the stream and respective track, which the media player
needs to decode the media frames.
GetMP4MediaFragment: Retrieves MP4 media fragments. These
fragments contain the &quot;moof&quot; and &quot;mdat&quot; MP4 atoms and their
child atoms, containing the encoded fragment's media frames and
their timestamps.
After the first media fragment is made available in a streaming
session, any fragments that don't contain the same codec private
data cause an error to be returned when those different media
fragments are loaded. Therefore, the codec private data should
not change between fragments in a session. This also means that
the session fails if the fragments in a stream change from
having only video to having both audio and video.
Data retrieved with this action is billable. See
Pricing
for details.



The following restrictions apply to MPEG-DASH sessions:
A streaming session URL should not be shared between players. The
service might throttle a session if multiple media players are
sharing it. For connection limits, see Kinesis Video Streams Limits.
A Kinesis video stream can have a maximum of ten active MPEG-DASH
streaming sessions. If a new session is created when the maximum
number of sessions is already active, the oldest (earliest created)
session is closed. The number of active GetMedia connections on a
Kinesis video stream does not count against this limit, and the
number of active MPEG-DASH sessions does not count against the
active GetMedia connection limit.
The maximum limits for active HLS and MPEG-DASH streaming sessions
are independent of each other.


You can monitor the amount of data that the media player consumes by
monitoring the GetMP4MediaFragment.OutgoingBytes Amazon CloudWatch
metric. For information about using CloudWatch to monitor Kinesis Video
Streams, see Monitoring Kinesis Video Streams.
For pricing information, see Amazon Kinesis Video Streams Pricing and AWS Pricing. Charges for both HLS sessions
and outgoing AWS data apply.
For more information about HLS, see HTTP Live Streaming on the Apple Developer site.
If an error is thrown after invoking a Kinesis Video Streams archived
media API, in addition to the HTTP status code and the response body, it
includes the following pieces of information:
x-amz-ErrorType HTTP header – contains a more specific error type
in addition to what the HTTP status code provides.
x-amz-RequestId HTTP header – if you want to report an issue to
AWS, the support team can better diagnose the problem if given the
Request Id.


Both the HTTP status code and the ErrorType header can be utilized to
make programmatic decisions about whether errors are retry-able and
under what conditions, as well as provide information on what actions
the client programmer might need to take in order to successfully try
again.
For more information, see the Errors section at the bottom of this
topic, as well as Common Errors." />

    <tr>
      <th>StreamName</th>

<p>You must specify either the <code>StreamName</code> or the <code>StreamARN</code>.</p></td>

    <tr>
      <th>StreamARN</th>
      <td><p>The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stream for which to retrieve the
MPEG-DASH manifest URL.</p>
<p>You must specify either the <code>StreamName</code> or the <code>StreamARN</code>.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>PlaybackMode</th>
      <td><p>Whether to retrieve live, live replay, or archived, on-demand data.</p>
<p>Features of the three types of sessions include the following:</p><ul>
<li><p><strong><code>LIVE</code></strong> : For sessions of this type, the MPEG-DASH manifest is
continually updated with the latest fragments as they become
available. We recommend that the media player retrieve a new
manifest on a one-second interval. When this type of session is
played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a
"live" notification, with no scrubber control for choosing the
position in the playback window to display.</p>
<p>In <code>LIVE</code> mode, the newest available fragments are included in an
MPEG-DASH manifest, even if there is a gap between fragments (that
is, if a fragment is missing). A gap like this might cause a media
player to halt or cause a jump in playback. In this mode, fragments
are not added to the MPEG-DASH manifest if they are older than the
newest fragment in the playlist. If the missing fragment becomes
available after a subsequent fragment is added to the manifest, the
older fragment is not added, and the gap is not filled.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>LIVE_REPLAY</code></strong> : For sessions of this type, the MPEG-DASH
manifest is updated similarly to how it is updated for <code>LIVE</code> mode
except that it starts by including fragments from a given start
time. Instead of fragments being added as they are ingested,
fragments are added as the duration of the next fragment elapses.
For example, if the fragments in the session are two seconds long,
then a new fragment is added to the manifest every two seconds. This
mode is useful to be able to start playback from when an event is
detected and continue live streaming media that has not yet been
ingested as of the time of the session creation. This mode is also
useful to stream previously archived media without being limited by
the 1,000 fragment limit in the <code>ON_DEMAND</code> mode.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>ON_DEMAND</code></strong> : For sessions of this type, the MPEG-DASH manifest
contains all the fragments for the session, up to the number that is
specified in <code>MaxMediaPlaylistFragmentResults</code>. The manifest must be
retrieved only once for each session. When this type of session is
played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a
scrubber control for choosing the position in the playback window to
display.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In all playback modes, if <code>FragmentSelectorType</code> is
<code>PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP</code>, and if there are multiple fragments with the same
start timestamp, the fragment that has the larger fragment number (that
is, the newer fragment) is included in the MPEG-DASH manifest. The other
fragments are not included. Fragments that have different timestamps but
have overlapping durations are still included in the MPEG-DASH manifest.
This can lead to unexpected behavior in the media player.</p>
<p>The default is <code>LIVE</code>.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>DisplayFragmentTimestamp</th>
      <td><p>Per the MPEG-DASH specification, the wall-clock time of fragments in the
manifest file can be derived using attributes in the manifest itself.
However, typically, MPEG-DASH compatible media players do not properly
handle gaps in the media timeline. Kinesis Video Streams adjusts the
media timeline in the manifest file to enable playback of media with
discontinuities. Therefore, the wall-clock time derived from the
manifest file may be inaccurate. If DisplayFragmentTimestamp is set to
<code>ALWAYS</code>, the accurate fragment timestamp is added to each S element in
the manifest file with the attribute name “kvs:ts”. A custom MPEG-DASH
media player is necessary to leverage this custom attribute.</p>
<p>The default value is <code>NEVER</code>. When DASHFragmentSelector is
<code>SERVER_TIMESTAMP</code>, the timestamps will be the server start timestamps.
Similarly, when DASHFragmentSelector is <code>PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP</code>, the
timestamps will be the producer start timestamps.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>DisplayFragmentNumber</th>
      <td><p>Fragments are identified in the manifest file based on their sequence
number in the session. If DisplayFragmentNumber is set to <code>ALWAYS</code>, the
Kinesis Video Streams fragment number is added to each S element in the
manifest file with the attribute name “kvs:fn”. These fragment numbers
can be used for logging or for use with other APIs (e.g. <code>GetMedia</code> and
<code>GetMediaForFragmentList</code>). A custom MPEG-DASH media player is necessary
to leverage these this custom attribute.</p>
<p>The default value is <code>NEVER</code>.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>DASHFragmentSelector</th>
      <td><p>The time range of the requested fragment and the source of the
timestamps.</p>
<p>This parameter is required if <code>PlaybackMode</code> is <code>ON_DEMAND</code> or
<code>LIVE_REPLAY</code>. This parameter is optional if PlaybackMode is`` <code>LIVE</code>.
If `PlaybackMode` is `LIVE`, the `FragmentSelectorType` can be set, but
the `TimestampRange` should not be set. If `PlaybackMode` is `ON_DEMAND`
or `LIVE_REPLAY`, both `FragmentSelectorType` and `TimestampRange` must
be set.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Expires</th>
      <td><p>The time in seconds until the requested session expires. This value can
be between 300 (5 minutes) and 43200 (12 hours).</p>
<p>When a session expires, no new calls to <code>GetDashManifest</code>,
<code>GetMP4InitFragment</code>, or <code>GetMP4MediaFragment</code> can be made for that
session.</p>
<p>The default is 300 (5 minutes).</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>MaxManifestFragmentResults</th>
      <td><p>The maximum number of fragments that are returned in the MPEG-DASH
manifest.</p>
<p>When the <code>PlaybackMode</code> is <code>LIVE</code>, the most recent fragments are
returned up to this value. When the <code>PlaybackMode</code> is <code>ON_DEMAND</code>, the
oldest fragments are returned, up to this maximum number.</p>
<p>When there are a higher number of fragments available in a live
MPEG-DASH manifest, video players often buffer content before starting
playback. Increasing the buffer size increases the playback latency, but
it decreases the likelihood that rebuffering will occur during playback.
We recommend that a live MPEG-DASH manifest have a minimum of 3
fragments and a maximum of 10 fragments.</p>
<p>The default is 5 fragments if <code>PlaybackMode</code> is <code>LIVE</code> or <code>LIVE_REPLAY</code>,
and 1,000 if <code>PlaybackMode</code> is <code>ON_DEMAND</code>.</p>
<p>The maximum value of 1,000 fragments corresponds to more than 16 minutes
of video on streams with 1-second fragments, and more than 2 1/2 hours
of video on streams with 10-second fragments.</p></td>
