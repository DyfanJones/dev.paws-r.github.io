<meta property="og:title" content="AWS Security Token Service — sts" />

<meta property="og:description" content="The AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a web service that enables you
to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and
Access Management (IAM) users or for users that you authenticate
(federated users). This guide provides descriptions of the STS API. For
more detailed information about using this service, go to Temporary Security Credentials.
For information about setting up signatures and authorization through
the API, go to Signing AWS API Requests
in the AWS General Reference. For general information about the Query
API, go to Making Query Requests
in Using IAM. For information about using security tokens with other
AWS products, go to AWS Services That Work with IAM
in the IAM User Guide.
If you're new to AWS and need additional technical information about a
specific AWS product, you can find the product's technical
documentation at http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/.
Endpoints
By default, AWS Security Token Service (STS) is available as a global
service, and all AWS STS requests go to a single endpoint at
https://sts.amazonaws.com. Global requests map to the US East (N.
Virginia) region. AWS recommends using Regional AWS STS endpoints
instead of the global endpoint to reduce latency, build in redundancy,
and increase session token validity. For more information, see Managing AWS STS in an AWS Region
in the IAM User Guide.
Most AWS Regions are enabled for operations in all AWS services by
default. Those Regions are automatically activated for use with AWS STS.
Some Regions, such as Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), must be manually
enabled. To learn more about enabling and disabling AWS Regions, see
Managing AWS Regions
in the AWS General Reference. When you enable these AWS Regions, they
are automatically activated for use with AWS STS. You cannot activate
the STS endpoint for a Region that is disabled. Tokens that are valid in
all AWS Regions are longer than tokens that are valid in Regions that
are enabled by default. Changing this setting might affect existing
systems where you temporarily store tokens. For more information, see
Managing Global Endpoint Session Tokens
in the IAM User Guide.
After you activate a Region for use with AWS STS, you can direct AWS STS
API calls to that Region. AWS STS recommends that you provide both the
Region and endpoint when you make calls to a Regional endpoint. You can
provide the Region alone for manually enabled Regions, such as Asia
Pacific (Hong Kong). In this case, the calls are directed to the STS
Regional endpoint. However, if you provide the Region alone for Regions
enabled by default, the calls are directed to the global endpoint of
https://sts.amazonaws.com.
To view the list of AWS STS endpoints and whether they are active by
default, see Writing Code to Use AWS STS Regions
in the IAM User Guide.
Recording API requests
STS supports AWS CloudTrail, which is a service that records AWS calls
for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By
using information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what
requests were successfully made to STS, who made the request, when it
was made, and so on.
If you activate AWS STS endpoints in Regions other than the default
global endpoint, then you must also turn on CloudTrail logging in those
Regions. This is necessary to record any AWS STS API calls that are made
in those Regions. For more information, see Turning On CloudTrail in Additional Regions
in the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.
AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a global service with a single
endpoint at https://sts.amazonaws.com. Calls to this endpoint are
logged as calls to a global service. However, because this endpoint is
physically located in the US East (N. Virginia) Region, your logs list
us-east-1 as the event Region. CloudTrail does not write these logs to
the US East (Ohio) Region unless you choose to include global service
logs in that Region. CloudTrail writes calls to all Regional endpoints
to their respective Regions. For example, calls to
sts.us-east-2.amazonaws.com are published to the US East (Ohio) Region
and calls to sts.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com are published to the EU
(Frankfurt) Region.
To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find
your log files, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide." />
